ee_3dmodels
===========

This is a collection of the 3D models I use for producing renders of my electronics projects, along with some saved compositions of them.

It's separate from the electronics repo ('ee') since the files are large.

It contains a number of other peoples' components libraries as well -- this isn't meant to be all my work, rather it's the saved state of the 3D-rendering setup.
